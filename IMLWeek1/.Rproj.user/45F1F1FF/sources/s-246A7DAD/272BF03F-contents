This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
5 + 4


```
```{r}
fuu <- 5
bar = 4
fuu + bar
```

Ctrl + Alt + i to open new r block
Ctrl + Shift + Enter to run the block
```{r}
(buu = 3)
```

```{r}
summer <- function(a,b) {
  a + b
}
```

```{r}
(summer(fuu,bar))

```
###looping
```{r}
for(i in 0:11){
  print(summer(i,1))
}
```
```{r}
lapply(0:11,function(x) summer(x,x))
```
### anonymous function --> r list

### r is one indexed

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
```{r}
plot(cars)
x <- cars$speed
y<- cars$dist
model = lm(y~x)
#(model.coefficients[0])
#k = model.coefficients[1]
#min_s = min(cars$speed)
#max_s = max(cars$speed)
#lines(min_s:max:s,i + k *(min_s:max_s), col="red")
#model
```
```{r}
```
